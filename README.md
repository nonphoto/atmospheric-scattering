# midterm-sky
A shader that simulates atmospheric scattering and its effect on clouds.

I completed this project as a midterm assignment for Computational Graphics at Williams College with Benji Jones as a teammate. We plan on porting this to shadertoy as soon as possible. Take a look at mainpage.dox for more details.
